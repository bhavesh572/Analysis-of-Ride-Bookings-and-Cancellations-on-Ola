## 🧠 SQL Analysis – Business Questions Solved

SQL was used extensively to analyze ride patterns, cancellation behavior, revenue contribution, and service quality metrics.

### ✅ Key Business Questions Addressed

1. What is the overall ride booking success rate?
2. How are cancellations distributed between customers and drivers?
3. Which vehicle categories have the highest cancellation rates?
4. Does payment method influence ride completion?
5. What are the peak booking hours?
6. How does weekend demand compare with weekday demand?
7. Which vehicle types contribute most to total revenue?
8. What is the average trip distance and fare by vehicle category?
9. How do driver and customer ratings vary across vehicle segments?
10. What percentage of bookings result in incomplete rides?

## 🔍 Key Insights

* Driver-initiated cancellations account for a significant portion of booking failures.
* Weekend demand shows strong potential for increased revenue.
* Certain vehicle categories consistently outperform others in ratings and distance traveled.
* Digital payment methods (UPI and card) are associated with higher ride completion rates.

---

## ✅ Business Recommendations

* Implement driver-level cancellation monitoring with incentive/penalty mechanisms.
* Promote high-performing vehicle categories during peak demand hours.
* Encourage digital payment adoption to reduce friction and improve completion rates.
* Optimize weekend pricing and availability strategies to maximize revenue.
